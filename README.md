# Mengobrol Chat App UI (Static)

A Chat app UI inspired by [Mengobrol - Chat App by Asal Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/22351367-Mengobrol-Chat-App), created using Flutter.

**Note** - It is just a Static UI, I tried to clone it for practicing flutter basics, Widgets like Column, Row, SingleChildScrollableView, SafeArea etc.
